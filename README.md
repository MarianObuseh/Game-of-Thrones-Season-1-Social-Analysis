# Game-of-Thrones-Season-1-Social-Network-Analysis

Jusr for fun! Here, I write a Python program that analyzes the network dynamics of the Game of Thrones characters from the first season. Each row in the dataset contains the names of two characters, the number of scenes that they appeared together in (hence, the “strength” of their relationship), and the season of the series for the number of scenes value. I tried to form communities and obtain some key metrices.

## NB
This dataset has more information than I ended up using for my analysis. Therefore, I really didn't do anything with the “strength” information from this dataset.
