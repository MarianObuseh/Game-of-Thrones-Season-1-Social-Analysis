# Game of Thrones Season 1 Social Network Analysis

Here, I write a Python program that analyzes the network dynamics of the Game of Thrones characters from the first season. Each row in the dataset contains the names of two characters, the number of scenes that they appeared together in (hence, the “strength” of their relationship), and the season of the series for the number of scenes value. I use a number of packages - including networkx and community. I particularly love the visuals from my analysis:)

## NB
This dataset has more information than I ended up using for my analysis. Therefore, I really didn't do anything with the “strength” information from this dataset. I will (should) do another analysis with this dataset and utilize the strength of character information. Should be more fun:)
